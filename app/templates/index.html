<p>
SchistoTarget is a machine-learning classifier for the identification of immunoreactive proteins.
The classifier uses 17 different machine-learning techniques to discriminate between positive and negative immunoractive proteins. 
The protein immunoreactivity predictions are highly valuable for identifying genes important for host-parasite interaction and the discovery of novel drug and vaccine targets.
